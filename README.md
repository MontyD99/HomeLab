# HomeLab
# Summary

I built a personalized home lab using Elastic as my SIEM and Kali as my Virtual Machine. I forwarded data from the Kali VM to the SIEM using the Elastic Beats agent, generated security events on the Kali VM using Nmap, and queried and analyzed the logs in the SIEM using the Elastic web interface. I also created a dashboard to visualize security events and then created an alert to detect security events.

The images included in this project are screenshots of the security events being captured.
