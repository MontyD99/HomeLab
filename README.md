# HomeLab
# Summary

For this project I have built a personalized home lab using Elastic as my SIEM and Kali as my Virtual Machine. Forwarding data from the Kali VM to the SIEM using the Elastic Beats agent, I successfully generated security events on the Kali VM by using Nmap. Next, I queried and analyzed the logs in the SIEM using the Elastic web interface. Finally, I created a dashboard to visualize security events and then created an alert to detect said security events.

The images included in this project are screenshots of the security events being captured.
